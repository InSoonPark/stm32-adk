\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

The results obtained with this work can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Added the support of Android Open ADK to STM32 microcontrollers' family.
	\item Defined a communication protocol for the exchange of messages between the iNEMO board and the Android device.
	\item Implemented the communication protocol both in the firmware and in the Android application.
	\item Implemented a set of task in the firmware that guarantees a correct communication with the Android device.
	\item Implemented a complete Android application that can establish a communication with the iNEMO board and show to the user the data originated from the sensors integrated on the board (for now in a textual way). The user can also change the acquisition parameters and choose which sensors have to be monitored.
\end{itemize}


Future developments for this work:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Show the data originated from the sensors in a graphical way (sliding graphs as in the Windows application iNEMO Suite).
	\item Implement a complete compilation chain based on gcc and Makefile, in order to get rid of the limitations imposed by Keil uVision IDE.
	\item Improve the graphic of the application.
\end{itemize}
